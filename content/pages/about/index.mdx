Hi!

I'm Rnjai. After dropping computer science during school, I decided to take it up again during college.

College, my lacklusture experience/ performance at three companies and the failure to generally fit-in led me to jump from Delhi to Mexico City to try my luck at a 5-person Mexican FinTech. And I was blown away by the what we could produce when wavelengths matched all around, trust was a default and people cared about eachother.
